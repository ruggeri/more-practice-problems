**Swap Pairs in An Array**

Given an input array like `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]`, swap the
first two elements, then the next two, then the next two, etc. In the
example, the result should be `["b", "a", "d", "c", "f", "e"]`. Write
two versions: one which modifies the original array, and a second that
creates a new array for the result, leaving the original unmodified.

You may assume the input has an even number of items.
