**Remove Duplicates**

Given an array of numbers like `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1, 8, 5]`, return a new
array with all the duplicates removed. The items in the new array
should appear in the same order as they first occurred in the original
array. In our example, `result=[1, 3, 4, 8, 5]`.

When you have done that, write a new version where, instead of
creating a new array, we modify the input and remove the items from
it.
