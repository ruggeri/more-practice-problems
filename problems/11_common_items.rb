**Find Items in Common**

Given two input arrays of numbers, return an array of numbers found in
both arrays. There should be no repeats within the result, even if a
number occurs multiple times in both input arrays.

For instance, if the input is `nums1 = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5]` and `nums2 =
[5, 1, 7, 2, 6, 8]`, then the result should be `result =
[1, 2, 5]`. For us, it does not matter in what order the numbers
appear: `[1, 2, 5]` is as good as `[2, 1, 5]` or `[5, 1, 2]`, etc. We
only care that all numbers in both inputs appear exactly once in the
result, and no others.
