**Valid Parentheses**

You are given an input string; you should return true if every left
parenthesis matches with a subsequent right parenthesis; otherwise
return false. For this exercise, you may ignore any non-parentheses
characters.

For instance, `"a((bb)c(dd))(e)"` has every parenthesis matched. On
the other hand, `")a("` is not correct, because the initial right
parenthesis is not closing any left parenthesis; likewise the final
left parenthesis is not closed by any right parenthesis.
