**First Unique Character**

Given an input string, return the position of the first character that
does not repeat later in the string. For instanze, if the input is
`"curiecountsribbons"`, then the first character that doesn't repeat
is the 'e' at position 4. Therefore you should return 4.

If every character repeats, as in `"gizmogizmo"`, please return `nil`.

You may assume the string contains only lowercase letters.
