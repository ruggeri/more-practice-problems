**Integer To String**

Given an input integer like `123`, turn it into a string: `"123"`. You
are only allowed to use the `to_s` method on one-digit numbers,
otherwise the problem would be too easy. For instance: `1.to_s` is
allowed, but `12.to_s` is forbidden.

Hint: you may wish to use the `%` remainder operation. It may also
help to remember that when dividing two integers in Ruby, Ruby always
rounds down. For instance: `9/4==2`, and `9%4==1`.
